# PSStoreGamePageGallery

For some reason, the PlayStation Store website doesnt display the screenshots of the games. They are included in the html body though. This script embeds a gallery on a game page.
On click the image will be enlarged.

## Example

Before:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5NIx0AS.png" width="500">

After:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/heZVe7t.jpeg" width="500">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KGCFjFz.jpeg" width="500">

## How To Use

You need a browser extension that allows you to run userscripts. Copy the content of the .js file into a script and the screenshot gallery will be displayed on game pages.
